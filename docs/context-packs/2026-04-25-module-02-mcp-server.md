# Module 02 — MCP Server (Context Pack)

## Header

- **Date:** 2026-04-25
- **Module:** 02 — MCP Server
- **Feature Pack:** `docs/feature-packs/02-mcp-server/`
- **Branch at start:** `feat/02-mcp-server` (off `main` at the Module 01 closeout)
- **Branch at end:** `feat/02-mcp-server` (29 commits, ready for squash merge to `main`)
- **Verification report:** `docs/verification/2026-04-25-module-01-02-verification.md`
- **CI status at closeout:** all 3 jobs green on `fca5488` (lint+typecheck+unit · postgres migrations integration · end-to-end)

## Outcome

Module 02 ships the Coodra MCP server as a working production-grade product. Nine tools, two transports, a three-layer auth chain, an idempotent + cache-first policy engine with circuit breaker, append-only audit writes, graceful shutdown drain, and a 559-test suite (358 unit + 177 integration + 24 e2e) running green in CI on every push. A live Claude Code → coodra round-trip was demonstrated end-to-end through the production-shaped `.mcp.json` profile after the verification-fix batch landed (see "Live closeout demo" below).

## Scope boundary

### In scope (and shipped)

- **9 MCP tools, all with §24.3-anatomy descriptions and §9.1.2 canonical soft-failure shapes:**
  - `ping` (S5) — health probe.
  - `get_run_id` (S8) — run mint + projects auto-create in solo, soft-failure in team.
  - `get_feature_pack` (S9) — FS-first loader with parent-chain inheritance + 60s TTL cache.
  - `save_context_pack` (S10) — DB-first write + FS materialisation, idempotent per runId.
  - `search_packs_nl` (S11) — sqlite-vec / pgvector semantic + LIKE fallback.
  - `record_decision` (S13) — append-only `decisions` table, hash-keyed dedupe.
  - `query_run_history` (S12) — chronological + LEFT JOIN `context_packs.title`.
  - `check_policy` (S14) — cockatiel-fused, fail-open, async audit-write, per-projectId cache.
  - `query_codebase_graph` (S15) — Graphify subgraph reader, two-soft-failure split.
- **Two transports** (S5 stdio, S16 Streamable HTTP) startable concurrently via `--transport stdio|http|both`.
- **Three-layer auth chain (§19):** solo-bypass → `X-Local-Hook-Secret` (timing-safe) → Clerk JWT → 401.
- **DB schema:** 11 tables (Module 01's 5 + Module 02's 4 + S13's `decisions`) across 4 migrations (0000–0003), sha256-locked preserve-blocks for sqlite-vec + pgvector HNSW.
- **Cross-cutting:** ToolRegistry auto-wraps every call in pre/post policy evaluation; idempotency-key contracts enforced at construction + at `policy_decisions.idempotency_key` UNIQUE; graceful shutdown drains pending audit writes via `setImmediate` tick before closing the DB.
- **Verification:** live binary exercised against a fresh DB; 545-test suite + 24 e2e all green; six findings surfaced (§8.1–§8.6) and fixed in the same batch.

### Explicitly deferred (named below for the next module to pick up)

- **Finding #3 deeper question.** §8.3's minimum-viable fix shipped (`COODRA_DB_OVERRIDE_MODE` env knob). The deeper architectural question — `system-architecture.md §1` claims "local services always write to local SQLite", but `packages/db/src/client.ts::createDb` routes `team → Postgres` unconditionally — is **deferred to a separate planning round**. A future architecture decision is needed: should `createDb` always return SQLite for local services with Postgres confined to a sync layer? That changes the Module 03 sync-daemon shape and is out of scope for Module 02 closeout.

- **Finding #5 first-run UX.** §8.5's env-knob fix shipped (`COODRA_CONTEXT_PACKS_ROOT` + `COODRA_GRAPHIFY_ROOT`). The richer first-run experience — a `coodra init` CLI that bootstraps `~/.coodra/`, materialises a starter `.env`, and runs the auto-migrate before the IDE first connects — is **deferred to Module 08a** per `essentialsforclaude/08-implementation-order.md` §8.1.

- **Finding #6 follow-up.** §8.6's schema-layer fix shipped at the registry boundary. The runtime `assertRunKeySegment` helper in `packages/shared/src/idempotency.ts` is retained as a defensive second line. The deeper question — should EVERY run-key-segment-bearing field across the codebase carry the same Zod schema validation, including future tool inputs? — is open as a design-level note, not a blocking fix.

- **`run_events` not yet exercised.** Verification §8.7 noted the `RunRecorder` is wired but never invoked on the Module 02 path. By design — `run_events` is the trace surface for Module 03's Hooks Bridge dispatching PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook deliveries. Module 03 lights it up.

- **Real Clerk JWT live verification.** The auth chain is integration- and e2e-tested with a sentinel-bypass and `X-Local-Hook-Secret` paths. The Clerk JWT branch is exercised against `@clerk/backend::verifyToken` with synthetic tokens but not against a real Clerk session token. Production deployment will exercise this; logged in `context_memory/pending-user-actions.md`.

## Decisions made

- **Factory vs static-const tool registration** — locked in `essentialsforclaude/09-common-patterns.md §9.1.1` (S8). Factory shape when handler closes over `DbHandle` / `mode` / clock; static const for pure handlers. The barrel registers both uniformly.
- **Canonical `{ ok: false, error, howToFix }` soft-failure shape** — locked in `09-common-patterns.md §9.1.2` (S9, hardened S11). Every soft-failure carries an enum `error` + a non-empty `howToFix`; tool-specific fields are additive.
- **Discriminated-union output schemas** for tools with structured failure modes (S9 onward; tightened by S14's reason-enum lock). Agent contract: callers must check `response.ok && response.data.ok` for tools that use this pattern.
- **`PerCallContext.agentType` additive slot** (S8) for transport-supplied client identity.
- **Per-projectId policy cache + `PolicyClient.evaluate({ projectId? })` additive extension** (S14) closing the S7b deferral. Frozen-interface preserved via additive-optional.
- **`GraphifyClient.expandContextBySlug` additive method** (S15) closing the S7c reservation, mirroring the Q9 sign-off pattern that landed `getIndexStatus`.
- **`recordPolicyDecision` first-caller landed at S14** (closes S7b deferral). Async dispatch via `setImmediate` keeps the `<10 ms` hook-SLO; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the locked `pd:{sessionId}:{toolName}:{eventType}` key handles retries.
- **Hybrid Node listener for HTTP transport** (S16) — `/mcp` dispatched directly via `http.createServer` to the SDK transport, `/healthz` + 404 delegated to Hono via `getRequestListener`. MCP SDK's response-write conflicts with Hono's Response-return contract; the hybrid is the cleanest solve.
- **transport sessionId hyphen separator** (S17 bug-trace) — `http-${uuid}` / `stdio-${uuid}` rather than colon. Caught by the e2e full-session scenario; the runId encoding `run:{projectId}:{sessionId}:{uuid}` requires colon-free segments.
- **8 KiB toolInputSnapshot truncation** (S14, user push-back) — prevents `policy_decisions` row bloat from large-body tool inputs while preserving forensic original-size info via `…[truncated:N]` suffix.
- **Verification fix batch ships in one push** rather than dripping over multiple PRs — six findings closed in 5 commits + 1 CI fix; cleaner reviewable unit, all addressed before merge.

## Files created or modified (highlights)

### Workspace shape

- `apps/mcp-server/` — new workspace, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0`, Hono `4.12.15`, `@hono/node-server@2.0.0`, cockatiel `3.2.1`, `@clerk/backend@3.3.0`, picomatch `4.0.2`, drizzle-orm `0.45.2`, zod `4.x`.
- `packages/db/` — schema additions (4 new tables: `policies`, `policy_rules`, `policy_decisions`, `feature_packs`; migration 0003 added `decisions`). Migration lock + `ensurePgVector` helper.
- `packages/shared/` — `assertManifestDescriptionValid` test helper (S6); `runKeySegmentSchema` (verification fix §8.6).

### MCP server source layout

- `apps/mcp-server/src/`
  - `bootstrap/ensure-stderr-logging.ts`
  - `config/env.ts` — full env schema + mode-conditional `superRefine` + verification fix env knobs.
  - `framework/` — tool-registry, idempotency, manifest-from-zod, policy-wrapper, tool-context.
  - `lib/` — agent-type, auth, context-pack, db, errors, feature-pack, graphify, logger, policy, run-recorder, sqlite-vec.
  - `tools/` — 9 folders (ping/get-run-id/get-feature-pack/save-context-pack/search-packs-nl/record-decision/query-run-history/check-policy/query-codebase-graph), each with `schema.ts` / `handler.ts` / `manifest.ts`. `index.ts` is the registration barrel.
  - `transports/` — `stdio.ts`, `http.ts`.
  - `index.ts` — entrypoint with `--transport` flag, auto-migrate at boot, graceful shutdown drain.

### Architecture + governance docs

- `system-architecture.md` — §24.4 amended for every tool (S8–S15) with full input/output shapes, soft-failures, idempotency rules.
- `docs/feature-packs/02-mcp-server/implementation.md` — every slice (S5–S17) rewritten in "what landed" style.
- `context_memory/decisions-log.md` — 30+ decision entries timestamped across S5–S17 + verification fix batch.

## Tests

- **358 unit tests** across `@coodra/shared` (75) + `@coodra/db` (42) + `@coodra/mcp-server` (241) — manifest contracts, schema boundaries, factory construction, idempotency-key shapes, registry behaviour, lib factories.
- **177 integration tests** in `apps/mcp-server/__tests__/integration/` — real sqlite + Hono in-process + subprocess boot. Covers each tool against a real DB, the auth chain, transport round-trips, and the post-fix boot/migration behaviour.
- **24 e2e tests** at the repo root in `__tests__/e2e/` (5 scenarios) — manifest e2e via SDK Client, http-roundtrip with three auth modes, policy-decisions idempotency under 10× concurrent calls (testcontainers Postgres), full single-session walk through all 9 tools with DB+FS assertions, stdio subprocess spawn.
- **Manifest e2e via §6.6 synthetic agent test** — validates the exact 9-tool set, ≤800-char descriptions, Ajv 2020-12 JSON Schema round-trip, minimal-valid-input round-trip per tool.

## How integration was verified

### Test-suite verification (CI)

- All 559 tests green on every push from S11 onward.
- Three CI jobs all green on `fca5488` (Module 02 closeout SHA): lint+typecheck+unit (41s), postgres migrations integration (59s), end-to-end (36s).

### Live end-to-end verification report (2026-04-25)

`docs/verification/2026-04-25-module-01-02-verification.md` — built the binary from clean, booted it, walked every tool against non-trivial inputs, inspected DB tables + FS materialisation, triggered each soft-failure, proved the graceful-shutdown audit drain, and tested the live Claude Code → coodra route. Six findings surfaced and were closed in the verification fix batch.

### Live closeout demo (post-restart, 2026-04-25)

After the user restarted Claude Code (production-shaped `.mcp.json` profile pointing at `apps/mcp-server/dist/index.js`), the IDE spawned a fresh subprocess against the post-fix dist. **All 9 tools were exercised live through `mcp__coodra__*` calls in this Claude Code session**:

- `ping` — round-trip succeeded; `sessionId: stdio-174c17ad-…` (hyphen separator confirms post-S17 fix in production binary).
- `get_run_id { projectSlug: "coodra" }` → minted `run:proj_bd336220-…:stdio-174c17ad-…:b98eff0b-…`; auto-created the `coodra` project; auto-migrate at boot ran cleanly (no `no such table: projects`).
- `get_feature_pack { projectSlug: "02-mcp-server" }` → 158 KB pack returned with parent inheritance from `01-foundation`; SHA256 checksum present.
- `record_decision` × 2 + retry → 2 distinct `decisionId`s; retry with same description returned the original ID with `created: false` (idempotency dedupe verified).
- `check_policy { …, toolName: "Write", toolInput: { file_path: "/tmp/demo.ts" } }` → `allow / no_rule_matched / failOpen: false`; audit row dispatched async to `policy_decisions` (1 row visible after).
- `query_codebase_graph { projectSlug: "coodra", query: "createDb" }` → `codebase_graph_not_indexed` soft-failure with `howToFix: "run \`graphify scan\` at repo root"`.
- `save_context_pack { runId, title, content }` → `cp_b6590ef5-…` persisted; FS file at `docs/context-packs/2026-04-25-run-proj_bd33622.md` (note the **hyphen** — Fix §8.4 verified live).
- `query_run_history { projectSlug: "coodra", limit: 5 }` → returned the run with `status: completed`, `endedAt` populated, joined `title` from the saved pack.
- `search_packs_nl { projectSlug: "coodra", query: "live MCP demo" }` → LIKE-fallback found the pack; `notice: "no_embeddings_yet"` with Module 05 howToFix.

Final DB state after the live demo: `projects: 1, runs: 1, decisions: 2, context_packs: 1, policy_decisions: 1, feature_packs: 2`.

The live demo serves as evidence that the agent-discovery contract works at the §24.3 anatomy level — descriptions are readable enough that a future agent can pick the right tool unprompted (description-anatomy review notes are in the verification report §7.3).

## Known limitations / open follow-up

Carried forward from the verification report:

1. **§8.3 deeper architectural question** — see "Scope boundary > Explicitly deferred" above. Separate planning round needed before Module 03's sync daemon design.
2. **§8.5 first-run UX** — the env knobs are functional; the richer `coodra init` CLI lands with Module 08a.
3. **§8.6 design-level note** — schema validation now at the registry boundary; the broader question of universal run-key-segment validation remains a stylistic decision, not a fix.
4. **`pending-user-actions.md`** — Clerk live token verification, real GitHub App registration, real Atlassian OAuth client, all marketing/distribution items remain user-side ops.

## What should be built next

**Module 03 — Hooks Bridge.** Per `essentialsforclaude/08-implementation-order.md §8.1`. The Hooks Bridge consumes the MCP tool surface from Module 02 — it dispatches `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` events to the running Coodra server (the consumer for the `RunRecorder` wiring noted in §8.7), enforces the policy-deny path returned by `check_policy`, and threads JIRA / GitHub integration data into runs. Spec lives at `docs/feature-packs/03-hooks-bridge/`.

Resolve the Finding #3 architectural question before locking the Module 03 sync-daemon shape — the answer changes whether the Hooks Bridge writes through to Postgres directly (current `createDb` semantics) or always to local SQLite with a separate sync layer (the §1 docstring claim).
